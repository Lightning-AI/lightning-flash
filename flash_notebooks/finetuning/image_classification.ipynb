    "In this notebook, we'll go over the basics of lightning Flash by finetuning an ImageClassifier on [Hymenoptera Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/ajayrana/hymenoptera-data) containing ants and bees images.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Finetuning\n",
    "\n",
    "Finetuning consists of four steps:\n",
    " \n",
    " - 1. Train a source neural network model on a source dataset. For computer vision, it is traditionally  the [ImageNet dataset](http://www.image-net.org/search?q=cat). As training is costly, library such as [Torchvion](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torchvision/index.html) library supports popular pre-trainer model architectures . In this notebook, we will be using their [resnet-18](https://pytorch.org/hub/pytorch_vision_resnet/).\n",
    " \n",
    " - 2. Create a new neural network  called the target model. Its architecture replicates the source model and parameters, expect the latest layer which is removed. This model without its latest layer is traditionally called a backbone\n",
    " \n",
    " - 3. Add new layers after the backbone where the latest output size is the number of target dataset categories. Those new layers, traditionally called head will be randomly initialized while backbone will conserve its pre-trained weights from ImageNet.\n",
    " \n",
    " - 4. Train the target model on a target dataset, such as Hymenoptera Dataset with ants and bees. At training start, the backbone will be frozen, meaning its parameters won't be updated. Only the model head will be trained to properly distinguish ants and bees. On reaching first finetuning milestone, the backbone latest layers will be unfrozen and start to be trained. On reaching the second finetuning milestone, the remaining layers of the backend will be unfrozen and the entire model will be trained. In Flash, `trainer.finetune(..., unfreeze_milestones=(first_milestone, second_milestone))`.\n",
