# In this notebook, we'll go over the basics of lightning Flash by training a TabularClassifier on [Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).

# # Training

# In[ ]:

get_ipython().run_cell_magic('capture', '', '! pip install lightning-flash')

# In[ ]:

from torchmetrics.classification import Accuracy, Precision, Recall

import flash
from flash.data.utils import download_data
from flash.tabular import TabularClassifier, TabularData

# ###  1. Download the data
# The data are downloaded from a URL, and save in a 'data' directory.

# In[ ]:

download_data("https://pl-flash-data.s3.amazonaws.com/titanic.zip", 'data/')

# ###  2. Load the data
# Flash Tasks have built-in DataModules that you can use to organize your data. Pass in a train, validation and test folders and Flash will take care of the rest.
#
# Creates a TabularData relies on [Pandas DataFrame](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html).

# In[ ]:

datamodule = TabularData.from_csv(
    train_csv="./data/titanic/titanic.csv",
    test_csv="./data/titanic/test.csv",
    categorical_input=["Sex", "Age", "SibSp", "Parch", "Ticket", "Cabin", "Embarked"],
    numerical_input=["Fare"],
    target="Survived",
    val_size=0.25,
)

# ###  3. Build the model
#
# Note: Categorical columns will be mapped to the embedding space. Embedding space is set of tensors to be trained associated to each categorical column.

# In[ ]:

model = TabularClassifier.from_data(datamodule, metrics=[Accuracy(), Precision(), Recall()])

# ###  4. Create the trainer. Run 10 times on data

# In[ ]:

trainer = flash.Trainer(max_epochs=10)

# ###  5. Train the model

# In[ ]:

trainer.fit(model, datamodule=datamodule)

# ###  6. Test model

# In[ ]:

trainer.test()

# ###  7. Save it!

# In[ ]:

trainer.save_checkpoint("tabular_classification_model.pt")

# # Predicting

# ###  8. Load the model from a checkpoint
#
# `TabularClassifier.load_from_checkpoint` supports both url or local_path to a checkpoint. If provided with an url, the checkpoint will first be downloaded and laoded to re-create the model.

# In[ ]:

model = TabularClassifier.load_from_checkpoint("https://flash-weights.s3.amazonaws.com/tabular_classification_model.pt")

# ###  9. Generate predictions from a sheet file! Who would survive?
#
# `TabularClassifier.predict` support both DataFrame and path to `.csv` file.

# In[ ]:

predictions = model.predict("data/titanic/titanic.csv")

# In[ ]:

print(predictions)
